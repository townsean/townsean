### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Ashley! I'm software engineer and I love hackathons, tabletop gaming, woodworking and spending time with my family. 

Here my websites:
* [The Coding Couple](https://www.thecodingcouple.com/) - where I blog about programming (a joint effort with my spouse)
* [Handmade with Ashley](https://www.handmadewithashley.com) - where I share things I've crafted 
* [Cardboard Bits](https://www.cardboardbits.com) - home for my board game reviews and RPG campaign logs
